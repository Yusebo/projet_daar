In recent years various museums have issued lists of the type specimens
in their collections. These lists are valuable to systematists by
providing these workers with information that otherwise sometimes is
difficult to obtain. Although by comparison with the large museums in
the eastern part of the United States, such as the American Museum of
Natural History, the United States National Museum, and the Museum of
Comparative Zoology at Harvard, the herpetological collections in the
Museum of Natural History at The University of Kansas are relatively
small (70,000 specimens), a large number of types are contained in the
collection. The largest number of types are of species described from
Costa Rica by Edward H. Taylor between 1949 and 1958. Beginning in
1932 and continuing until World War II, Taylor described many species
from México; types of these species were contained in the Edward H.
Taylor--Hobart M. Smith collection. Inquiries from herpetologists
reveal that many workers suppose that the EHT-HMS collection is in
the Museum of Natural History. Such is not the case, for the EHT-HMS
collection has been divided between the Chicago Natural History Museum
and the University of Illinois Museum of Natural History.

The list of type specimens presented here includes all holotypes
and paratypes that are known in the museum as of April 15, 1962.
Only specimens actually designated as paratypes by the original
describer are considered as such. Each species or subspecies is
listed in the combination as it was originally proposed. If the name
has been subjected to subsequent nomenclatural change or has been
placed in synonymy, the name in current use is given after an equals
sign, together with a citation to the authority for the change. The
arrangement in the following list is alphabetical by genus and species
within orders (suborders in the Squamata). Current combinations of
names that have been changed subsequent to their original proposal are
listed in the correct alphabetical place with a cross-reference to the
original combination.

All original citations have been checked, and actual dates of
publication are given for each. The checking of original citations,
museum catalogues, labels, and sometimes collectors’ field catalogues
has revealed numerous errors. In some cases the catalogue numbers
of the holotypes and paratypes given by Taylor actually were his
field numbers. In the following list the museum numbers that were
subsequently assigned are given. Certain localities have been given
incorrectly; for example, Taylor described several species from Moravia
de Chirripó, which he gave as being in Limón Province, Costa Rica.
Actually Moravia de Chirripó is in Cartago Province. We have attempted
to correct all such errors.

The holotype and two paratypes of _Rana taylori_ Smith are stated to
be in the Museum of Natural History. Smith (Herpetologica, 15:214,
December 8, 1959) proposed the name _Rana taylori_ for three specimens
discussed by Taylor (Univ. Kansas Sci. Bull., 35:906, July 1, 1952),
who gave the numbers 2976-2978. Number 2978 was designated the holotype
of _Rana taylori_ by Smith, who never saw the frogs. The numbers
2976-2978 are E. H. Taylor’s field numbers; the specimens never have
been catalogued in the Museum of Natural History, and their present
location is unknown.

The 125 species and subspecies represented by holotypes and paratypes
in the collection are distributed among the orders of amphibians and
reptiles as follows:

                               AMPHIBIA

                 Gymnophiona (Caecilians)          3
                 Caudata (Salamanders)            20
                 Salientia (Frogs and Toads)      39


                               REPTILIA

                 Testudines (Turtles)              5
                 Sauria (Lizards)                 31
                 Serpentes (Snakes)               27

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
